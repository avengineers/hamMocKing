Installation
============

Currently hammock is provided on the **testing server** of pypi.org. Use pip to install as follows:

..  code-block:: shell

    pip install --trusted-host test.pypi.org --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple hammock


Hammock depends on the libraries `Jinja2` and `libclang`. They will be installed automatically unless you have them already on the system.
